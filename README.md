# DialectoScope

## Overview
DialectoScope is a project aimed at classifying regional dialects in textual data using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, including pre-trained BERT models.

## Features
- Utilizes ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes for dialect classification.
- Explores DL techniques like LSTM, RNN, and pre-trained BERT models to improve classification accuracy.
- Provides insights into linguistic diversity and aids in language research and cultural preservation efforts.

## Directory Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the training and testing datasets.
- `Models/`: Stores the trained ML and DL models.
- `Notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
